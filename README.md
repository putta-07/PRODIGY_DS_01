# Top 10 Most Populous Countries in 2023

This colab Notebook analyzes population data from the World Bank to identify and visualize the top 10 most populous countries in 2023.

## Data Source

The notebook uses the following dataset from the World Bank:

* **API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_85220.csv:** Contains total population data for various countries over different years.
## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** The notebook first reads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. It then dynamically detects the header row and extracts relevant columns for the analysis (Country Name and 2023 population data). Missing values are handled appropriately.
2. **Data Transformation:** The population data is converted to numeric format for calculations and sorting.
3. **Top 10 Identification:** The DataFrame is sorted based on the 2023 population to identify the top 10 most populous countries.
4. **Visualization:** A bar chart is generated using Matplotlib to visually represent the population of these countries. The chart includes labels, titles, and gridlines for clarity.

## How to Use

1. **Download:** Download the colab Notebook file and the dataset (API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_85220.csv) from this repository.
2. **Environment:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the necessary libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib). You can install them using `pip install pandas matplotlib`.
3. **Execution:** Open the notebook in a colab environment (e.g., Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook) and execute the cells sequentially.
4. **Output:** The notebook will generate a bar chart displaying the top 10 most populous countries in 2023.

## Insights

The bar chart provides a clear visualization of the relative population sizes of the top 10 countries. You can observe the significant differences in population between these countries. This information can be valuable for various demographic analyses and research.
